# Random-Maze-Game
A simple game of solving randomly generated mazes.

The programs in the Helper Programs and Maze Algorithms folders aren't necessary, they just break the game down into some core components for easier understanding.

To get the game to actually work, you need to have the basigui.py module in the same place as random_maze_game.py

In the random_maze_game.py file, you will need to change the line terminal_border = pygame.image.load(r'full filepath to fallout_terminal_border.jpg') to include your filepath to fallout_terminal_border.jpg

Enjoy!
